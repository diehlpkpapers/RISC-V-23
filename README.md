# Evaluating HPX and Kokkos on RISC-V using an astrophysics application Octo-Tiger

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/659430609.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/659430609)



Input data and scripts for the Octo-Tiger runs. The `rotating_star.bin` file is generated by running 
`generate.sh`. Since this file is the base for all levels, there is no need to develop it multiple times. 
The file `rotating_star.ini` is the input file. The mesh file can be downloaded from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/8111772).
The archive's content from Zendo needs to be unpacked in the root folder. 

### Instructions

- generate.sh - Generates the file rotating_star.bin
- run_node_level.sh - Runs the node level scaling
- run_distributed_mpi.sh - Runs distributed MPI 
- run_distributedtcp.sh - Runs distributed TCP
- pjusb -s run.sh - Runs distributed MPI on Fugaku
